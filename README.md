# GT-SheepScab
Model code for paper "Uptake of diagnostic tests by livestock farmers: a stochastic game theory approach"


# Requirements:
- Running version of R

# Basic instructions

- ‘Sheep_scab_main_version.R’ runs the stochastic game (with basic plotting facilities), 
- Probabilities and payoffs are retrieved from the input file ‘Sheep_scab_inputs.R’, which draws on the function ADAS_parameters.R
- All other functions are sourced from folder 'code_GT_paper/fun/';
